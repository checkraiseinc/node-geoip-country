GeoIP-lite-country
==================

Stripped down node-geoip-lite. Only supports country lookup, both IPv4 and IPv6.

Software is written by Philip Tellis <philip@bluesmoon.info>, latest version is available at https://github.com/bluesmoon/node-geoip


synopsis
--------

```javascript
var geoip = require('geoip-lite');

var ip = "207.97.227.239";
var geo = geoip.lookup(ip);

console.log(geo);
{ range: [ 3479299040, 3479299071 ],
  country: 'US',
  region: '' }
```

installation
------------
### 1. get the library

    $ npm install geoip-lite-country

### 2. get the datafiles

Then download the city data files from https://github.com/bluesmoon/node-geoip/tree/master/data
You need to get `geoip-city.dat` and `geoip-city-names.dat` and put them into the `data/` directory
of this package.

API
---

### Looking up an IP address ###

If you have an IP address in dotted quad notation, IPv6 colon notation, or a 32 bit unsigned integer (treated
as an IPv4 address), pass it to the `lookup` method.  Note that you should remove any `[` and `]` around an
IPv6 address before passing it to this method.

```javascript
var geo = geoip.lookup(ip);
```

If the IP address was found, the `lookup` method returns an object with the following structure:

```javascript
{
   range: [ <low bound of IP block>, <high bound of IP block> ],
   country: 'XX',                 // 2 letter ISO-3166-1 country code
}
```

The actual values for the `range` array should be considered internal to `geoip-lite`.
To get a human readable format, pass them to `geoip.pretty()`

If the IP address was not found, the `lookup` returns `null`

### Pretty printing an IP address ###

If you have a 32 bit unsigned integer, or a number returned as part of the `range` array from the `lookup` method,
the `pretty` method can be used to turn it into a human readable string.

```javascript
    console.log("The IP is %s", geoip.pretty(ip));
```

This method returns a string if the input was in a format that `geoip-lite` can recognise, else it returns the
input itself.
